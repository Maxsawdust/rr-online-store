# ONLINE STORE PROJECT

This project sets out to showcase my knowledge of React Router, and furthers my knowledge of working with state and context.

## Home Page

The home page came with its own challenges of working with context and making sure the state remained between mount and unmount.
I enjoyed creating it though, and if I were to re-visit this later on, I would try to make it so you cannot click the buttons until "logged in"

## Products Page

The Products page helped further my understanding of dynamically rendering elements from objects in React, and posed its own challenges too. Mainly trying to get the Cart component to fit to the side nicely. I think if I did this again, I'd have styled that component quite differently.
